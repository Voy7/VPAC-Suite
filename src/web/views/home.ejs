                        <p class="question">Q: How serious are we about milsim?</p><br />
                        <p>A: About a 7/10. We aim to be realistic in most aspects, but do not expect anyone to fly by the book. We understand people are on different skill levels and just want you to try your best. As long as you can communicate with your flight members effectively and operate your aircraft safely, you will be fine!</p>

                        <p class="question">Q: What do the missions look like?</p>
                        <p>A: We fly 2-3 hour long missions every Friday and Saturday night. Typically 1 mission will be on a free map, while the other will most likely be on Syria or Persian Gulf. There may also be mid-week missions at the discretion of squadron leaders. For information on mission times, see the #mission-announcements channel on Discord.</p>

                        <p class="question">Q: How do I start flying with VPAC?</p>
                        <p>A: Before you can join a squadron and start flying in our missions, you will need to schedule and fly a checkride flight with your squadron leader. Once you have filled out <a href="https://forms.gle/S7ddem74tqikrY5T9">an application</a>, your squadron leader will contact you to schedule a time. Information on the checkride requirements can be found on the <a href="/squadrons">Squadrons page</a>.</p>
